        Pastor Jamie Cheramie was born in 1970 in the heart of a small Cajun community in Golden Meadow, Louisiana. Growing up, he worked alongside his father on a shrimp boat, learning the values of hard work and perseverance. But his life took a transformational turn on October 30, 1984, when, at just 14 years old, he gave his life to Christ.

        Two years later, he felt the unmistakable call to ministry, following in the footsteps of his older brother. Determined to deepen his faith and knowledge, he enrolled at Criswell College in Dallas, Texas, at the age of 18. It was there that he met the love of his life, Tasha. The two married in 1991, and three years later, in 1994, he graduated from Bible college. Afterward, he continued his theological studies at Denver Seminary, where he graduated in 1997, further equipping himself for a life dedicated to ministry. Together, Pastor Jamie and Tasha have been blessed with three wonderful children.
        
        Pastor Jamie has a deep love for God’s Word, and one verse that holds special meaning in his heart is Zephaniah 3:17—a reminder that God rejoices over His people with singing. His passion for worship is also reflected in his favorite song, “More Like Jesus” by Canaan Baca.
        
        Throughout his years in ministry, Pastor Jamie has experienced countless unforgettable moments, but one of the funniest remains the time he slipped and fell in the baptismal pool—completely soaking the youth choir in the process! His love for sports keeps him active, and his boldness in sharing the Gospel has led him to some unexpected places—perhaps the most surprising being when he was detained by Russian police and used the opportunity to witness about Christ.
        
        One of his most cherished experiences as a pastor was his three-week trip to Israel, where he walked in the footsteps of Jesus and gained a deeper understanding of biblical history.
        
        With a heart for people and a passion for sharing God’s love, Pastor Jamie Cheramie continues to lead, inspire, and serve, always pointing others to Christ with joy and unwavering faith.
