    <p class="beliefs-text">
        At Buchanan West Baptist Church, we believe that Jesus Christ is the only way to Heaven. He is God in the flesh, who came to earth, lived a sinless life, and willingly shed His blood and died on the cross for our salvation. Through His resurrection, He conquered sin and death, offering eternal life to all who put their faith in Him.

        As a church, we are committed to our core values in our vision statement Worship in spirit and truth, Witness to others, and Work through serving others
        
            •	Word – We believe according to the Baptist Faith  and Message 2000 the Bible is God’s perfect and inspired truth. It is our foundation for faith, teaching, and daily living. We are dedicated to studying, preaching, and applying Scripture in all we do.
        
            •	Worship – We gather to honor and glorify God with heartfelt praise, prayer, and devotion. Worship is not just a Sunday practice but a lifestyle of surrender and gratitude to God.
        
            •	Witness – We are called to share the good news of Jesus Christ with our community and beyond. Through evangelism and discipleship, we seek to lead others to the saving grace of Jesus.
        
            •	Work – Our faith is lived out through service. We strive to love and help others, meeting spiritual and physical needs through ministry, missions, and acts of kindness.
        
        At Buchanan West Baptist Church, we seek to follow Christ wholeheartedly, living out His teachings in every aspect of our lives.
